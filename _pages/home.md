We are a research group at the [DataLab](https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/) at the [Infomation School of University of Washington](https://ischool.uw.edu/). 

Predicting urban events such as transportation resource demand, traffic accidents, and traffic volumes relies on spatio-temporal neural methods. Existing approaches frequently use a common set of urban features (typically held by government agencies) such as road network and weather. Even as data is increasingly available through open data portals, identifying which datasets will improve a model amounts to trial and error, preparing the relevant datasets for use in neural models requires substantial effort, not all relevant datasets are available publicly due to privacy and administrative limitations, and training separate models for each task is expensive and redundant. We explore a different approach in which common set of integrated features learned across all relevant datasets can be pre-trained and reused across many tasks.  Government agencies can periodically release a master CityTensor that encodes the dynamic features of the city to be used directly to improve prediction tasks.  These features can provide better utility for city data, complementing "raw" access through open data portals, and potentially provide a single point of control for privacy and bias management. To this end, we propose a neural architecture to integrate a significant number of urban datasets into a learned spatiotemporal tensor, analogous to the role of pre-trained word vectors for NLP applications.

<!--
To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)). -->

<!--
We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Quantum Matter & Optics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home), as well as with the colleagues from our [world-class theory section](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl).  -->

 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**  -->


We are grateful for funding from [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/) and collaborators from [UW DataLab](https://datalab.ischool.uw.edu/) and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/).
